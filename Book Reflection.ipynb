I was expecting a book filled with stories about computer security, firewalls, and how people break into complex code. While it definitely has some of that, I was surprised to find that the book's main idea is much bigger and, honestly, much more interesting. The biggest thing I learned is that \"hacking\" is not just a computer thing; it is a human mindset. It is a way of looking at the world, and it applies to every system, not just digital ones.\n","\n","As I was reading, I learned that Bruce Schneier's main point is that hacking is really about finding loopholes. It is about looking at any system, whether it is the tax code, the financial market, or even airline frequent flier rules, and figuring out how to follow the letter of the rules to get a result that totally violates their spirit or intention. The book shows how this is done all the time, especially by powerful people, to bend the systems of our society for their own benefit. For example, loopholes in political donation laws or complex financial products are not \"breaking\" the system; they are \"hacking\" it. This idea really opened my eyes. I stopped thinking of a \"hack\" as just breaking a password and started seeing it as a way of thinking that is all around us.\n","\n","What really clicked for me, especially for our course on XAI, was the chapter on Hacking AI Systems. This part felt the most personal and relevant to my studies. The book talks about two big risks: first, that AI systems themselves can be hacked (like with adversarial attacks), and second, that AI systems can become the hackers. This second point is what I found most powerful. An AI has the ability to look for loopholes at a speed and scale that no human ever could. It can test millions of possibilities in seconds to find a weakness in a system, whether that system is a stock market, a legal code, or a social network.\n","\n","The book discusses the \"explainability problem,\" which we have talked a lot in class. This concept is directly related to another idea from the book: \"reward hacking.\" This is where an AI finds a clever, unintended way to get its reward. It is following the letter of its programming but completely missing the spirit of what we wanted it to do. This is a perfect example of Schneier's definition of hacking. If an AI is a \"black box\" and we cannot understand how it makes decisions, how can we be sure it is operating in good faith? How do we know it is not engaging in reward hacking to achieve its goal in a way that is destructive or counter to our intentions?\n","\n","In the end, reading this book made me realize that Explainable AI (XAI) is not just a cool technical feature or something we add for compliance. It is a fundamental part of security. If we are building these powerful AI systems, we are basically building new systems for our society to run on. And as this book taught me, any system can and will be hacked. If we cannot explain what our AI is doing or why it is doing it, we have no way to find the loopholes it is using (or creating) until it is too late. This book put my entire study of XAI into a new, much more urgent perspective. It is not just about making better AI; it is about making sure the powerful systems we are building remain safe and aligned with our human values."],"metadata":{"id":"_fofeV3oWc9b"}}]}
